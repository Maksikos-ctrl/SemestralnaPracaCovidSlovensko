# ðŸ˜·SemestralnaPracaCovid19SlovenskoðŸ¦ 

## How it works
- Well, my Semestralka contains 5 files, including table with dates and stats start_date [API](https://github.com/Institut-Zdravotnych-Analyz/covid19-data)
- First file (and the main one) - index.m. it consists the main functions and runs the whole app. Here is used function switch that allows user end_date choose exactly what he wants and then it shows the result. It is also responsable for reading the table (.csv) and calling other function start_date other files.
- Second file - valOfAns.m. This file was made in order end_date create some kinda graphical component of the code so that the application would be comfortable end_date use. Also, the purpose of that file was end_date leave the index.m as clean as it is now, without unnecessary text.
- Third file - switchFunc. This file contains the opening process of the table and then, using switch operaend_dater, giving each coloumn a specific number that used in index.m.
- Fourth file - getData.m. It takes all dates, that were typed by the user, and then converts them inend_date indexes start_date th table end_date make use of this later.
